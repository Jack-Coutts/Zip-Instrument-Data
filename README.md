# Zip-Instrument-Data

This repository contains a python script that can be used to zip (compress) all subdirectories within a given directory. 

## How to download the script?

You can download this README file, the License and the Python script [here](https://github.com/Jack-Coutts/Zip-Instrument-Data/archive/refs/tags/v0.1.0.zip). This
will download a zipped folder containing the three files mentioned above but the only that you will need is the Python script 
[zipping_instrument_raw_data.py](https://github.com/Jack-Coutts/Zip-Instrument-Data/blob/main/zipping_instrument_raw_data.py). 

## How to run the script?

To run this script you should move the 'zipping_instrument_raw_data.py' file to a location on you machine where you can access it easily   
E.g. Users -> Name -> Documents -> Zipping. In this case the file path would be Users/Name/Documents/Zipping/zipping_instrument_raw_data.py.
